## Interactive notebooks [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dcdace/COGNESTIC-fMRI/3c365aa66f89ad79bbb8b4c267ef03adbf2d0506?urlpath=tree/hands-on)
[MyBinder.org ](https://mybinder.org)  is a service that allows you to run Jupyter notebooks directly online. However, this service comes with a restricted computational environment (1-2GB of RAM). This means, many notebooks might be very slow and some might even crash, due to not enough memory.

You can use this approach to run and test most of the notebooks. To access the MyBinder instance, click on the badge below.

## Download the notebooks and run on your computer
You can also download the notebooks and run on your computer. The environment required for that to work is in `environment.yml` [file](https://github.com/dcdace/COGNESTIC-fMRI/blob/master/environment.yml).
